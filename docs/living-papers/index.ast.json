Living Papers, a language toolkit for producing augmented academic articles that span print, interactive, and computational media.\nLiving Papers articles may include formatted text, references,

extraction APIs for paper content and metadata.\nWe describe Living Papers’ architecture, document model, and reactive runtime, and detail key aspects such as citation processing and conversion of interactive components to static content.\nWe demonstrate the use and extension of Living Papers through examples spanning traditional research papers, explorable explanations, information extraction, and reading aids such as enhanced citations, cross-references, and equations.\nLiving Papers is available as an extensible, open source platform intended to support both article authors and

pamphlets, healthcare consumers may turn to the research literature. Reading medical papers, however, can be a challenging experience. To improve access to medical papers, we introduce a novel interactive interface-Paper Plain-with four features powered by natural language processing: definitions of unfamiliar terms, in-situ plain language section summaries, a collection of key questions that guide readers to answering passages, and plain language summaries of the answering passages. We evaluate Paper Plain, finding that participants who use Paper Plain have an easier time reading and understanding research papers without a loss in paper comprehension compared to those who use a typical PDF reader. Altogether, the study results suggest that guiding readers to relevant passages and providing plain language summaries, or \"gists,\" alongside the original paper content can make reading medical papers easier and give readers more confidence to approach these papers.","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2203.00130","publisher":"arXiv","title":"Paper Plain: Making Medical Research Papers Approachable to

These formats each have their strengths and weaknesses, but existing authoring tools only support one output target. We conducted a series of formative interviews with seven domain experts to understand needs and practices around cross-format data stories, and developed Fidyll, a cross-format compiler for authoring interactive data stories and explorable explanations. Our open-source tool can be used to rapidly create formats including static articles, low-motion articles, interactive articles, slideshows, and videos. We evaluate our system through a series of real-world usage scenarios, showing how it benefits authors in the domains of data journalism, scientific publishing, and nonprofit advocacy. We show how Fidyll, provides expressive leverage by reducing the amount of non-narrative markup that authors need to write by 80-90% compared to Idyll, an existing markup language for authoring interactive articles.","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2205.09858","publisher":"arXiv","title":"Fidyll: A Compiler for Cross-Format Data Stories &amp; Explorable Explanations","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09858","copyright":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","version":"1"},{"author":[{"given":"Will","family":"Crichton"}],"type":"document","id":"nota","citation-key":"nota","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"title":"A New Medium for Communicating Research on Programming Languages","URL":"https://willcrichton.net/nota/"},{"author":[{"family":"Curvenote"}],"type":"document","id":"curvenote","citation-key":"curvenote","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"URL":"https://curvenote.com/"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,12]],"date-time":"2023-10-12T02:48:30Z","timestamp":1697078910463},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":101,"publisher":"ACM","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]],"date-time":"2019-05-02T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1556755200000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Background"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["dl.acm.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"DOI":"10.1145/3290605.3300295","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,29]],"date-time":"2019-04-29T17:04:32Z","timestamp":1556557472000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":57,"title":"Increasing the Transparency of Research Papers with Explorable Multiverse Analyses","prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Pierre","family":"Dragicevic","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Inria, Saclay, France"}]},{"given":"Yvonne","family":"Jansen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Paris, France"}]},{"given":"Abhraneel","family":"Sarma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"}]},{"given":"Matthew","family":"Kay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"}]},{"given":"Fanny","family":"Chevalier","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"}]}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_3_2_1_1_1","unstructured":"{n. d.}.

In this paper, we investigate the role that intelligent interfaces can play in helping researchers skim papers, that is, rapidly reviewing a paper to attain a cursory understanding of its contents. After conducting formative interviews and a design probe, we suggest that skimming aids should aim to thread the needle of highlighting content that is simultaneously diverse, evenly-distributed, and important. We introduce Scim, a novel intelligent skimming interface that reifies this aim, designed to support the skimming process by highlighting salient paper contents to direct a skimmer's focus. Key to the design is that the highlights are faceted by content type, evenly-distributed across a paper, with a density configurable by readers at both the global and local level. We evaluate Scim with an in-lab usability study and deployment study, revealing how skimming aids can support readers throughout the skimming experience and yielding design considerations and tensions for the design of future intelligent skimming tools.","container-title":"arXiv","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2205.04561","publisher":"arXiv","title":"Scim: Intelligent Skimming Support for Scientific Papers","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04561","copyright":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","version":"3"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,20]],"date-time":"2023-10-20T07:31:35Z","timestamp":1697787095829},"reference-count":106,"publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)","issue":"6379","funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/100000052","name":"NIH Office of the Director","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["P01 AG039347"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000052","name":"NIH Office of the Director","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["U01CA198934"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000052","name":"NIH Office of the Director","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["IIS-0910664"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000179","name":"NSF Office of the Director","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["NCSE 1538763"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000179","name":"NSF Office of the Director","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["EAGER1566393"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000181","name":"AFOSR","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","award":["FA9550-15-1-0077"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/501100000780","name":"European Commission","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["641191"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000179","name":"NSF Office of the Director","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["NCN CP Supplement 1553044"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000181","name":"AFOSR","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","award":["FA9550-15-1-0162"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000181","name":"AFOSR","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","award":["FA9550-17-1-0089"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000181","name":"AFOSR","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","award":["FA9550-15-1-0077"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000181","name":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["FA9550-15-1-0364"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000183","name":"Army Research Office","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["W911NF-15-1-0577"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,2]]},"abstract":"<jats:title>The whys and wherefores of SciSci</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>\n            The science of science (SciSci) is based on a transdisciplinary approach that uses large data sets to study the mechanisms underlying the doing of science—from the choice of a research problem to career trajectories and progress within a field.

As society continues on its fast-paced digital transformation, so does humankind's collective scientific knowledge and discourse. We now read and write papers in digitized form, and a great deal of the formal and informal processes of science are captured digitally -- including papers, preprints and books, code and datasets, conference presentations, and interactions in social networks and collaboration and communication platforms. The transition has led to the creation and growth of a tremendous amount of information -- much of which is available for public access -- opening exciting opportunities for computational models and systems that analyze and harness it. In parallel, exponential growth in data processing power has fueled remarkable advances in artificial intelligence, including large neural language models capable of learning powerful representations from unstructured text. Dramatic changes in scientific communication -- such as the advent of the first scientific journal in the 17th century -- have historically catalyzed revolutions in scientific thought. The confluence of societal and computational trends suggests that computer science is poised to ignite a revolution in the scientific process itself.","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2205.02007","publisher":"arXiv","title":"A Computational Inflection for Scientific Discovery","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02007","copyright":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","version":"2"},{"author":[{"family":"Jupyter Book"}],"type":"document","id":"jupyterbook","citation-key":"jupyterbook","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"URL":"https://jupyterbook.org/"},{"type":"article","id":"doi:10.48550/arXiv.2010.05129","categories":["Computation and Language (cs.CL)","FOS: Computer and information sciences","FOS: Computer and information sciences"],"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Dongyeop"},{"family":"Head","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Sidhu","given":"Risham"},{"family":"Lo","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Weld","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Hearst","given":"Marti A."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"abstract":"The task of definition detection is important for scholarly papers, because papers often make use of technical terminology that may be unfamiliar to readers. Despite prior work on definition detection, current approaches are far from being accurate enough to use in real-world applications. In this paper, we first perform in-depth error analysis of the current best performing definition detection system and discover major causes of errors. Based on this analysis, we develop a new definition detection system, HEDDEx, that utilizes syntactic features, transformer encoders, and heuristic filters, and evaluate it on a standard sentence-level benchmark. Because current benchmarks evaluate randomly sampled sentences, we propose an alternative evaluation that assesses every sentence within a document. This allows for evaluating recall in addition to precision. HEDDEx outperforms the leading system on both the sentence-level and the document-level tasks, by 12.7 F1 points and 14.4 F1 points, respectively. We note that performance on the high-recall document-level task is much lower than in the standard evaluation approach, due to the necessity of incorporation of document structure as features. We discuss remaining challenges in document-level definition detection, ideas for improvements, and potential issues for the development of reading aid applications.","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2010.05129","publisher":"arXiv","title":"Document-Level Definition Detection in Scholarly Documents: Existing Models, Error Analyses, and Future Directions","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05129","copyright":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","version":"1"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,12]],"date-time":"2023-10-12T02:55:07Z","timestamp":1697079307528},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":34,"publisher":"ACM","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,11]],"date-time":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1539216000000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Background"}],"funder":[{"name":"NSF award","award":["III-1714647"]},{"name":"Samsung Scholarship"},{"name":"Allen Distinguished Investigator award"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["dl.acm.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,11]]},"DOI":"10.1145/3242587.3242617","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,16]],"date-time":"2018-10-16T13:30:26Z","timestamp":1539696626000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":25,"title":"Facilitating Document Reading by Linking Text and Tables","prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Dae Hyun","family":"Kim","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"}]},{"given":"Enamul","family":"Hoque","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"}]},{"given":"Juho","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Rebublic of Korea"}]},{"given":"Maneesh","family":"Agrawala","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"}]}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,11]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_1_1","volume-title":"Retrieved","year":"2018","unstructured":"2018.

Semantic Scholar (S2) is an open data platform and website aimed at accelerating science by helping scholars discover and understand scientific literature. We combine public and proprietary data sources using state-of-the-art techniques for scholarly PDF content extraction and automatic knowledge graph construction to build the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph, the largest open scientific literature graph to-date, with 200M+ papers, 80M+ authors, 550M+ paper-authorship edges, and 2.4B+ citation edges. The graph includes advanced semantic features such as structurally parsed text, natural language summaries, and vector embeddings. In this paper, we describe the components of the S2 data processing pipeline and the associated APIs offered by the platform. We will update this living document to reflect changes as we add new data offerings and improve existing services.","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2301.10140","publisher":"arXiv","title":"The Semantic Scholar Open Data Platform","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10140","copyright":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","version":"1"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,19]],"date-time":"2023-10-19T15:03:44Z","timestamp":1697727824488},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":31,"publisher":"ACM","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,5]],"date-time":"2015-11-05T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1446681600000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Background"}],"funder":[{"name":"European Research Council","award":["321135"]},{"name":"Danish Strategic Research Council","award":["1311-00001B"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["dl.acm.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,5]]},"DOI":"10.1145/2807442.2807446","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,6]],"date-time":"2015-11-06T15:04:29Z","timestamp":1446822269000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":88,"title":"<i>Webstrates</i>","prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Clemens N.","family":"Klokmose","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"}]},{"given":"James R.","family":"Eagan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Télécom ParisTech -- CNRS LTCI UMR 5141, Paris, France"}]},{"given":"Siemen","family":"Baader","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"}]},{"given":"Wendy","family":"Mackay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"INRIA &amp; Univ Paris-Sud, Paris, France"}]},{"given":"Michel","family":"Beaudouin-Lafon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Univ Paris-Sud &amp; CNRS, Orsay, France"}]}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,5]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_1_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145/2669485.2669518"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145/332040.332473"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145/6592.6595"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_4_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145/2047196.2047226"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_5_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145/1753326.1753390"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_6_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145/1502800.1502803"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_7_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145/66926.66963"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_8_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145/1978942.1979446"},{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_9_1","volume-title":"Smalltalk-80: the language and its implementation","author":"Goldberg A.","year":"1983","unstructured":"Goldberg , A. and Robson , D .

Recent work has improved extraction accuracy by incorporating elementary layout information, for example, each token’s 2D position on the page, into language model pretraining. We introduce new methods that explicitly model VIsual LAyout (VILA) groups, that is, text lines or text blocks, to further improve performance. In our I-VILA approach, we show that simply inserting special tokens denoting layout group boundaries into model inputs can lead to a 1.9% Macro F1 improvement in token classification. In the H-VILA approach, we show that hierarchical encoding of layout-groups can result in up to 47% inference time reduction with less than 0.8% Macro F1 loss. Unlike prior layout-aware approaches, our methods do not require expensive additional pretraining, only fine-tuning, which we show can reduce training cost by up to 95%. Experiments are conducted on a newly curated evaluation suite, S2-VLUE, that unifies existing automatically labeled datasets and includes a new dataset of manual annotations covering diverse papers from 19 scientific disciplines. Pre-trained weights, benchmark datasets, and source code are available at

But charts do more than summarize data or reproduce tables; they afford interactive data exploration at varying levels of granularity—from fine‐grained datum‐by‐datum reading to skimming and surfacing high‐level trends. In response to the lack of comparable non‐visual affordances, we present a set of rich screen reader experiences for accessible data visualization and exploration. Through an iterative co‐design process, we identify three key design dimensions for expressive screen reader accessibility: <jats:italic>structure</jats:italic>, or how chart entities should be organized for a screen reader to traverse; <jats:italic>navigation</jats:italic>, or the structural, spatial, and targeted operations a user might perform to step through the structure; and, <jats:italic>description</jats:italic>, or the semantic content, composition, and verbosity of the screen reader's narration. We operationalize these dimensions to prototype screen‐reader‐accessible visualizations that cover a diverse range of chart types and combinations of our design dimensions. We evaluate a subset of these prototypes in a mixed‐methods study with 13 blind and visually impaired readers. Our findings demonstrate that these designs help users conceptualize data spatially, selectively attend to data of interest at different levels of granularity, and experience control and agency over their data analysis process.

These additional media augment the textual narrative in the document. However, the static layout of a traditional for-print document often impedes deep understanding of its content because of the need to navigate to access content scattered throughout the text. In this paper, we seek to facilitate enhanced comprehension of such documents through a contextual visualization technique that couples text content with data tables contained in the document. We parse the text content and data tables, cross-link the components using a keyword-based matching algorithm, and generate on-demand visualizations based on the reader's current focus within a document. We evaluate this technique in a user study comparing our approach to a traditional reading experience. Results from our study show that (1) participants comprehend the content better with tighter coupling of text and data, (2) the contextual visualizations enable participants to develop better summaries that capture the main data-rich insights within the document, and (3) overall, our method enables participants to develop a more detailed understanding of the document content.","tldr":"This paper parse the text content and data tables, cross-link the components using a keyword-based matching algorithm, and generate on-demand visualizations based on the reader's current focus within a document that couples text content with data tables contained in the document."},{"id":"doi:10.1145/179606.179671","doi":"10.1145/179606.179671","s2id":"bb31656a40655a5b8b0ee0d091881cc307b80c54","year":1992,"author":[{"given":"Tim","family":"Berners-Lee","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"CERN, Geneva, Switzerland"}]},{"given":"Robert","family":"Cailliau","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CERN, Geneva, Switzerland"}]},{"given":"Ari","family":"Luotonen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CERN, Geneva, Switzerland"}]},{"given":"Henrik Frystyk","family":"Nielsen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CERN, Geneva, Switzerland"}]},{"given":"Arthur","family":"Secret","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"CERN, Geneva, Switzerland"}]}],"title":"The World-Wide Web","venue":"Communications of the ACM","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/179606.179671","abstract":"Abstract This paper describes the World-Wide Web (W3) global information system initiative, its protocols and data formats, and how it is used in practice.

The problem with making PDFs accessible is in part due to the lack of good tools, but the complexity of the PDF format makes improving tools difficult. Making accessible research papers is as much about our choices as a community: our choice of publication format, and our choice to make accessibility a voluntary task for authors.

The science of science (SciSci) is based on a transdisciplinary approach that uses large data sets to study the mechanisms underlying the doing of science—from the choice of a research problem to career trajectories and progress within a field. In a Review, Fortunato et al. explain that the underlying rationale is that with a deeper understanding of the precursors of impactful science, it will be possible to develop systems and policies that improve each scientist's ability to succeed and enhance the prospects of science as a whole. Science, this issue p. eaao0185 BACKGROUND The increasing availability of digital data on scholarly inputs and outputs—from research funding, productivity, and collaboration to paper citations and scientist mobility—offers unprecedented opportunities to explore the structure and evolution of science. The science of science (SciSci) offers a quantitative understanding of the interactions among scientific agents across diverse geographic and temporal scales: It provides insights into the conditions underlying creativity and the genesis of scientific discovery, with the ultimate goal of developing tools and policies that have the potential to accelerate science. In the past decade, SciSci has benefited from an influx of natural, computational, and social scientists who together have developed big data–based capabilities for empirical analysis and generative modeling that capture the unfolding of science, its institutions, and its workforce. The value proposition of SciSci is that with a deeper understanding of the factors that drive successful science, we can more effectively address environmental, societal, and technological problems. ADVANCES Science can be described as a complex, self-organizing, and evolving network of scholars, projects, papers, and ideas. This representation has unveiled patterns characterizing the emergence of new scientific fields through the study of collaboration networks and the path of impactful discoveries through the study of citation networks. Microscopic models have traced the dynamics of citation accumulation, allowing us to predict the future impact of individual papers. SciSci has revealed choices and trade-offs that scientists face as they advance both their own careers and the scientific horizon. For example, measurements indicate that scholars are risk-averse, preferring to study topics related to their current expertise, which constrains the potential of future discoveries. Those willing to break this pattern engage in riskier careers but become more likely to make major breakthroughs. Overall, the highest-impact science is grounded in conventional combinations of prior work but features unusual combinations. Last, as the locus of research is shifting into teams, SciSci is increasingly focused on the impact of team research, finding that small teams tend to disrupt science and technology with new ideas drawing on older and less prevalent ones. In contrast, large teams tend to develop recent, popular ideas, obtaining high, but often short-lived, impact. OUTLOOK SciSci offers a deep quantitative understanding of the relational structure between scientists, institutions, and ideas because it facilitates the identification of fundamental mechanisms responsible for scientific discovery. These interdisciplinary data-driven efforts complement contributions from related fields such as scientometrics and the economics and sociology of science. Although SciSci seeks long-standing universal laws and mechanisms that apply across various fields of science, a fundamental challenge going forward is accounting for undeniable differences in culture, habits, and preferences between different fields and countries. This variation makes some cross-domain insights difficult to appreciate and associated science policies difficult to implement. The differences among the questions, data, and skills specific to each discipline suggest that further insights can be gained from domain-specific SciSci studies, which model and identify opportunities adapted to the needs of individual research fields. The complexity of science. Science can be seen as an expanding and evolving network of ideas, scholars, and papers. SciSci searches for universal and domain-specific laws underlying the structure and dynamics of science. ILLUSTRATION: NICOLE SAMAY Identifying fundamental drivers of science and developing predictive models to capture its evolution are instrumental for the design of policies that can improve the scientific enterprise—for example, through enhanced career paths for scientists, better performance evaluation for organizations hosting research, discovery of novel effective funding vehicles, and even identification of promising regions along the scientific frontier. The science of science uses large-scale data on the production of science to search for universal and domain-specific patterns. Here, we review recent developments in this transdisciplinary field.","tldr":"SciSci has revealed choices and trade-offs that scientists face as they advance both their own careers and the scientific horizon, and offers a deep quantitative understanding of the relational structure between scientists, institutions, and ideas, which facilitates the identification of fundamental mechanisms responsible for scientific discovery."},{"id":"gscholar","year":2023,"author":[{"family":"Google Scholar"}],"title":"","url":"https://scholar.google.com/"},{"id":"puppeteer","year":2023,"author":[{"family":"Google, Inc."}],"title":"Puppeteer","url":"https://pptr.dev/"},{"id":"markdown","year":2004,"author":[{"given":"John","family":"Gruber"}],"title":"Markdown","url":"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"},{"id":"doi:10.1145/369825.369829","doi":"10.1145/369825.369829","s2id":"56f45398e48e2c9f2f61a046cd1a3a7ea84da8c0","year":2001,"author":[{"given":"Steve","family":"Harrison","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Xerox Palo Alto, Reasearch Center, Palo Alto, CA"}]},{"given":"Scott","family":"Minneman","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Xerox Palo Alto, Reasearch Center, Palo Alto, CA"}]},{"given":"Maribeth","family":"Back","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Xerox Palo Alto, Reasearch Center, Palo Alto, CA"}]},{"given":"Anne","family":"Balsamo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Xerox Palo Alto, Reasearch Center, Palo Alto, CA"}]},{"given":"Mark","family":"Chow","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Xerox Palo Alto, Reasearch Center, Palo Alto, CA"}]},{"given":"Rich","family":"Gold","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Matt","family":"Gorbet","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Dale","family":"Mac Donald","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"title":"Design: the what of XFR: eXperiments in the future of reading","venue":"Interactions","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/369825.369829","abstract":"Step up to the joystick on the exhibit to the right.

Through an iterative co‐design process, we identify three key design dimensions for expressive screen reader accessibility: structure, or how chart entities should be organized for a screen reader to traverse; navigation, or the structural, spatial, and targeted operations a user might perform to step through the structure; and, description, or the semantic content, composition, and verbosity of the screen reader's narration. We operationalize these dimensions to prototype screen‐reader‐accessible visualizations that cover a diverse range of chart types and combinations of our design dimensions. We evaluate a subset of these prototypes in a mixed‐methods study with 13 blind and visually impaired readers. Our findings demonstrate that these designs help users conceptualize data spatially, selectively attend to data of interest at different levels of granularity, and experience control and agency over their data analysis process.
