However, to use web services often requires significant programming efforts and thus limits the people who can take advantage of them to only a small group of skilled programmers. In this dissertation, I will present a tool called Gneiss that extends the spreadsheet model to support four challenging aspects of using web services: programming two-way data communications with web services, creating interactive GUI applications that use web data sources, using hierarchical data, and using live streaming data. Gneiss contributes innovations in spreadsheet languages, spreadsheet user interfaces and interaction techniques to allow programming tasks that currently require writing complex, lengthy code to instead be done using familiar spreadsheet mechanisms. Spreadsheets are arguably the most successful and popular data tools among people of all programming levels. This work advances the use of spreadsheets to new domains and could benefit a wide range of users from professional programmers to end-user programmers.","container-title":"Carnegie Mellon University","DOI":"10.1184/R1/6714389.V1","publisher":"Carnegie Mellon University","title":"A Spreadsheet Model for Using Web Services and Creating Data-Driven Applications","URL":"https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/A_Spreadsheet_Model_for_Using_Web_Services_and_Creating_Data-Driven_Applications/6714389/1","copyright":"In Copyright"},{"author":[{"family":"Cuttle Labs Inc."}],"type":"webpage","id":"cuttle","citation-key":"cuttle","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"title":"Cuttle - Design tool for digital cutting machines","URL":"https://cuttle.xyz/"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,19]],"date-time":"2023-01-19T01:32:37Z","timestamp":1674091957668},"reference-count":26,"publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)","issue":"12","content-domain":{"domain":["dl.acm.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2004,12]]},"abstract":"<jats:p>\n            Programmers tend to understand programs by thinking of concrete examples.\n            <jats:italic>Example Centric Programming</jats:italic>\n            seeks to add IDE support for examples throughout the process of programming.

The problem is that programming languages typically assign dynamic meaning only to programs that are complete, i.e. syntactically well-formed and free of type errors. Consequently, live feedback presented to the programmer exhibits temporal or perceptive gaps.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This paper confronts this \"gap problem\" from type-theoretic first principles by developing a dynamic semantics for incomplete functional programs, starting from the static semantics for incomplete functional programs developed in recent work on Hazelnut. We model incomplete functional programs as expressions with holes, with empty holes standing for missing expressions or types, and non-empty holes operating as membranes around static and dynamic type inconsistencies. Rather than aborting when evaluation encounters any of these holes as in some existing systems, evaluation proceeds around holes, tracking the closure around each hole instance as it flows through the remainder of the program. Editor services can use the information in these hole closures to help the programmer develop and confirm their mental model of the behavior of the complete portions of the program as they decide how to fill the remaining holes. Hole closures also enable a fill-and-resume operation that avoids the need to restart evaluation after edits that amount to hole filling. Formally, the semantics borrows machinery from both gradual type theory (which supplies the basis for handling unfilled type holes) and contextual modal type theory (which supplies a logical basis for hole closures), combining these and developing additional machinery necessary to continue evaluation past holes while maintaining type safety. We have mechanized the metatheory of the core calculus, called Hazelnut Live, using the Agda proof assistant.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We have also implemented these ideas into the Hazel programming environment. The implementation inserts holes automatically, following the Hazelnut edit action calculus, to guarantee that every editor state has some (possibly incomplete) type. Taken together with this paper's type safety property, the result is a proof-of-concept live programming environment where rich dynamic feedback is truly available without gaps, i.e. for every reachable editor state.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/3290327","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,4]],"date-time":"2019-01-04T13:33:51Z","timestamp":1546608831000},"page":"1-32","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":20,"title":"Live functional programming with typed holes","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"3","author":[{"given":"Cyrus","family":"Omar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Chicago, USA"}]},{"given":"Ian","family":"Voysey","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA"}]},{"given":"Ravi","family":"Chugh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Chicago, USA"}]},{"given":"Matthew A.","family":"Hammer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Colorado Boulder, USA"}]}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,2]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_2_1_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017/S0956796800000186"},{"key":"e_1_2_2_2_1","volume-title":"Explicit Substitutions for Contextual Type Theory.

modify a running program. Liveness is one form of a more general class of behaviors by a programming environment that provide information to programmers about what they are constructing. This paper gives a brief historical perspective on liveness and proposes an extension of a hierarchy given in 1990, to now account for even more powerful execution-oriented tools for programmers. In addition, while liveness concerns the timeliness of execution feedback, considering a broader array of forms of feedback is helpful both in better understanding liveness and in designing ever more powerful development tools.","author":[{"given":"Steven L.","family":"Tanimoto"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Live Programming","collection-title":"LIVE '13","DOI":"10.1109/LIVE.2013.6617346","type":"paper-conference","id":"Tanimoto:2013:PEL","citation-key":"Tanimoto:2013:PEL","ISBN":"978-1-4673-6265-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"keyword":"Analysis Discussion LiveProgramming PositionPaper Requirements","page":"31-34","publisher-place":"San Francisco, California","publisher":"IEEE Press","title":"A Perspective on the Evolution of Live Programming"},{"author":[{"given":"Bret","family":"Victor"}],"type":"manuscript","id":"inventing-on-principle","citation-key":"inventing-on-principle","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"note":"Presented at the the Canadian University Software Engineering Conference (CUSEC)","title":"Inventing on Principle","URL":"https://vimeo.com/36579366"},{"author":[{"given":"Bret","family":"Victor"}],"type":"webpage","id":"learnable-programming","citation-key":"learnable-programming","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"title":"Learnable Programming","URL":"http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/"},{"author":[{"family":"Wikipedia contributors"}],"type":"document","id":"wikipedia-grafting","citation-key":"wikipedia-grafting","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"note":"[Online; accessed 01-September-2022]","title":"Grafting — Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grafting&oldid=1095365064"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]],"date-time":"2023-03-29T16:07:47Z","timestamp":1680106067605},"publisher-location":"New York, NY, USA","reference-count":41,"publisher":"ACM","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,2]],"date-time":"2017-05-02T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1493683200000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy#Background"}],"funder":[{"name":"DARPA AFRL, prime","award":["K000886-00-S06"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["dl.acm.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,2]]},"DOI":"10.1145/3025453.3025768","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,2]],"date-time":"2017-05-02T18:37:22Z","timestamp":1493750242000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":135,"title":"Voyager 2","prefix":"10.1145","author":[{"given":"Kanit","family":"Wongsuphasawat","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Zening","family":"Qu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Dominik","family":"Moritz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Riley","family":"Chang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Felix","family":"Ouk","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Anushka","family":"Anand","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Tableau Research, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Jock","family":"Mackinlay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Tableau Software, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Bill","family":"Howe","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Jeffrey","family":"Heer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]}],"member":"320","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,2]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_3_2_2_1_1","first-page":"669","article-title":"Automatic Selection of Partitioning Variables for Small Multiple Displays.

The source text of a program is far removed from its behavior. Bridging this conceptual gulf is what makes programming so inhumanly difficult -- we are not compilers. Subtext is a new medium in which the representation of a program is the same thing as its execution. Like a spreadsheet, a program is visible and alive, constantly executing even as it is edited. Program edits are coherent semantic transformations.The essence of this new medium is copying. Programs are constructed by copying and executed by copy flow: the projection of changes through copies. The simple idea of copying develops into a rich theory of higher-order continual copying of trees. Notably absent are symbolic names, the workhorse of textual notation, replaced by immediately-bound explicit relationships. Subtext unifies traditionally distinct programming tools and concepts, and enables some novel ones. Ancestral structures are a new primitive data type that combines the features of lists and records, along with unproblematic multiple inheritance. Adaptive conditionals use first-class program edits to dynamically adapt behavior.A prototype implementation shows promise, but calls for much further research. Subtext suggests that we can make programming radically easier, if we are willing to be radical.","tldr":"Subtext is a new medium in which the representation of a program is the same thing as its execution, and unifies traditionally distinct programming tools and concepts, and enables some novel ones."},{"id":"image-based","year":2021,"author":[{"given":"Jonathan","family":"Edwards"},{"given":"Tomas","family":"Petricek"}],"title":"Typed Image-based Programming with Structure Editing","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08993"},{"id":"Ellis1969THEGP","year":1969,"author":[{"given":"T.

Such \"data wrangling\" regularly involves reformatting data values or layout, correcting erroneous or missing values, and integrating multiple data sources. These transforms are often difficult to specify and difficult to reuse across analysis tasks, teams, and tools. In response, we introduce Wrangler, an interactive system for creating data transformations. Wrangler combines direct manipulation of visualized data with automatic inference of relevant transforms, enabling analysts to iteratively explore the space of applicable operations and preview their effects.

The problem is that programming languages typically assign dynamic meaning only to programs that are complete, i.e. syntactically well-formed and free of type errors. Consequently, live feedback presented to the programmer exhibits temporal or perceptive gaps. This paper confronts this \"gap problem\" from type-theoretic first principles by developing a dynamic semantics for incomplete functional programs, starting from the static semantics for incomplete functional programs developed in recent work on Hazelnut. We model incomplete functional programs as expressions with holes, with empty holes standing for missing expressions or types, and non-empty holes operating as membranes around static and dynamic type inconsistencies. Rather than aborting when evaluation encounters any of these holes as in some existing systems, evaluation proceeds around holes, tracking the closure around each hole instance as it flows through the remainder of the program. Editor services can use the information in these hole closures to help the programmer develop and confirm their mental model of the behavior of the complete portions of the program as they decide how to fill the remaining holes. Hole closures also enable a fill-and-resume operation that avoids the need to restart evaluation after edits that amount to hole filling. Formally, the semantics borrows machinery from both gradual type theory (which supplies the basis for handling unfilled type holes) and contextual modal type theory (which supplies a logical basis for hole closures), combining these and developing additional machinery necessary to continue evaluation past holes while maintaining type safety. We have mechanized the metatheory of the core calculus, called Hazelnut Live, using the Agda proof assistant. We have also implemented these ideas into the Hazel programming environment. The implementation inserts holes automatically, following the Hazelnut edit action calculus, to guarantee that every editor state has some (possibly incomplete) type. Taken together with this paper's type safety property, the result is a proof-of-concept live programming environment where rich dynamic feedback is truly available without gaps, i.e. for every reachable editor state.","tldr":"The semantics borrows machinery from both gradual type theory and contextual modal type theory, combining these and developing additional machinery necessary to continue evaluation past holes while maintaining type safety, and is a proof-of-concept live programming environment where rich dynamic feedback is truly available without gaps."},{"id":"doi:10.1145/3453483.3454059","doi":"10.1145/3453483.3454059","s2id":"98529f85b3ad96dfe2d5b047f66bac1484f80e9f","year":2021,"author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4502-7971","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Cyrus","family":"Omar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1081-2235","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"David","family":"Moon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6938-7379","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Andrew","family":"Blinn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, USA"}]},{"given":"Ian","family":"Voysey","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Carnegie Mellon University, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6578-2005","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nick","family":"Collins","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Chicago, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1339-2889","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ravi","family":"Chugh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Chicago, USA"}]}],"title":"Filling typed holes with live GUIs: ","venue":"Proceedings of the 42nd ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/98529f85b3ad96dfe2d5b047f66bac1484f80e9f","abstract":"Text editing is powerful, but some types of expressions are more naturally represented and manipulated graphically. Examples include expressions that compute colors, music, animations, tabular data, plots, diagrams, and other domain-specific data structures.

Uniquely, livelits are compositional: a livelit GUI can itself embed spliced expressions, which are typed, lexically scoped, and can in turn embed other livelits. Livelits are also uniquely live: a livelit can provide continuous feedback about the run-time implications of the client’s choices even when splices mention bound variables, because the system continuously gathers closures associated with the hole that the livelit is filling. We integrate livelits into Hazel, a live hole-driven programming environment, and describe case studies that exercise these novel capabilities. We then define a simply typed livelit calculus, which specifies how livelits operate as live graphical macros.

It is used in numerous popular textbooks and curricular settings. The World model conflates two different tasks -- the definition of an event processor and its execution -- into one. This conflation imposes a significant (even unacceptable) burden on student users in several educational settings where we have tried to use it, e.g., for teaching physics. While it was tempting to pile on features to address these issues, we instead used the Scheme language design dictum of removing weaknesses that made them seem necessary. By separating the two tasks above, we arrived at a slightly different primitive, the reactor, as our basis. This only defines the event processor, and a variety of execution operators dictate how it runs. The new design enables programmatic control over event-driven programs. This simplifies reflecting on program behavior, and eliminates many unnecessary curricular dependencies imposed by the old design. This work has been implemented in the Pyret programming language.

Live programming aims to support the development and comprehension of programs by providing more immediate feedback on program behavior, but the divide between code and behavior often remains. The goal of example-based live programming is to remove this gap by allowing programmers to explore the actual behavior of their code during development. This is achieved by defining live examples for parts of the application. The idea of live examples has been already addressed in other tools and environments. However, most of those solutions are limited to specific domains and are suitable only for small programs. Thus, we aim to extend the application of example-based live programming to more complex programs potentially spanning multiple modules. We investigate existing solutions to derive a set of requirements for an integration of live examples into source code. Based on these requirements we propose a new approach to live examples and present a prototype in its support. We reproduce, discuss, and extend scenarios from related work to show the practicality of our approach in the context of larger, more complicated, and with that also more realistic scenarios. Also, we measure and evaluate the system response time of our prototypical implementation. Our first results show that example-based live programming can provide more insights into the run-time behavior of parameterized code for non-trivial programs.

We find that Lyra enables users to rapidly develop customized visualizations, covering a design space comparable to existing programming‐based tools.","tldr":"Lyra enables users to rapidly develop customized visualizations, covering a design space comparable to existing programming‐based tools, and is evaluated for its expressivity and accessibility."},{"id":"yoshiki","year":2019,"author":[{"given":"Yoshiki","family":"Schmitz"}],"title":"I've been jamming on this concept for making data-driven designs...","url":"https://twitter.com/yoshikischmitz/status/1176642448077967362"},{"id":"natto-hn","year":2021,"author":[{"given":"Paul","family":"Shen"}],"title":"Show HN: Natto – a canvas for writing and manipulating JavaScript","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26478548"},{"id":"natto","year":2022,"author":[{"given":"Paul","family":"Shen"}],"title":"welcome! – natto","url":"https://natto.dev/"},{"id":"doi:10.1023/A:1008716330212","doi":"10.1023/a:1008716330212","s2id":"d857a39b5a421ace552e6a2f6c83977086fb982f","year":1999,"author":[{"given":"Frank M.","family":"Shipman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Catherine C.","family":"Marshall","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"title":"Formality Considered Harmful: Experiences, Emerging Themes, and Directions on the Use of Formal Representations in Interactive Systems: ","venue":"Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d857a39b5a421ace552e6a2f6c83977086fb982f","tldr":"It is posed that, while it is impossible to remove all formalisms from computing systems, system designers need to match the level of formal expression entailed with the goals and situation of the users -- a design criteria not commonly mentioned in current interface design."},{"id":"live-literals","year":2016,"author":[{"given":"Tijs","family":"Storm","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"given":"Felienne","family":"Hermans"}],"title":"Live Literals","url":"https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/livelit/livelit.html"},{"id":"doi:10.1016/S1045-926X(05)80012-6","doi":"10.1016/s1045-926x(05)80012-6","s2id":"0ba8fdbb23ca2ab15d2389cd68c10c410b467a70","year":1990,"author":[{"given":"Steven L.","family":"Tanimoto","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"title":"VIVA: A visual language for image processing: ","venue":"Journal of Visual Languages &amp; Computing","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ba8fdbb23ca2ab15d2389cd68c10c410b467a70","tldr":"VIVA is a proposed visual language for image processing that serves as an effective teaching tool for students of image processing and takes account of several secondary goals, including the completion of a software platform for research in human/image interaction and the establishment of a presentation medium for image-processing algorithms."},{"id":"Tanimoto:2013:PEL","doi":"10.1109/LIVE.2013.6617346","s2id":"cd95f3f397e967005d6f108d0dbf3c5c7ffbcce9","year":2013,"author":[{"given":"Steven L.","family":"Tanimoto"}],"title":"A Perspective on the Evolution of Live Programming","venue":"Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Live Programming","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cd95f3f397e967005d6f108d0dbf3c5c7ffbcce9","abstract":"Liveness in programming environments generally refers to the ability to modify a running program. Liveness is one form of a more general class of behaviors by a programming environment that provide information to programmers about what they are constructing. This paper gives a brief historical perspective on liveness and proposes an extension of a hierarchy given in 1990, to now account for even more powerful execution-oriented tools for programmers. In addition, while liveness concerns the timeliness of execution feedback, considering a broader array of forms of feedback is helpful both in better understanding liveness and in designing ever more powerful development tools.","tldr":"While liveness concerns the timeliness of execution feedback, considering a broader array of forms of feedback is helpful both in better understanding liveness and in designing ever more powerful development tools."},{"id":"inventing-on-principle","year":2012,"author":[{"given":"Bret","family":"Victor"}],"title":"Inventing on Principle","url":"https://vimeo.com/36579366"},{"id":"learnable-programming","year":2012,"author":[{"given":"Bret","family":"Victor"}],"title":"Learnable Programming","url":"http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/"},{"id":"wikipedia-grafting","year":2022,"author":[{"family":"Wikipedia contributors"}],"title":"Grafting — Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grafting&oldid=1095365064"},{"id":"doi:10.1145/3025453.3025768","doi":"10.1145/3025453.3025768","s2id":"6a5003f5ae44c94401b93513e23ceb17922be3c4","year":2017,"author":[{"given":"Kanit","family":"Wongsuphasawat","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Zening","family":"Qu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Dominik","family":"Moritz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Riley","family":"Chang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Felix","family":"Ouk","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Anushka","family":"Anand","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Tableau Research, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Jock","family":"Mackinlay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Tableau Software, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Bill","family":"Howe","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Jeffrey","family":"Heer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]}],"title":"Voyager 2: Augmenting Visual Analysis with Partial View Specifications","venue":"Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a5003f5ae44c94401b93513e23ceb17922be3c4","abstract":"Visual data analysis involves both open-ended and focused exploration. Manual chart specification tools support question answering, but are often tedious for early-stage exploration where systematic data coverage is needed. Visualization recommenders can encourage broad coverage, but irrelevant suggestions may distract users once they commit to specific questions. We present Voyager 2, a mixed-initiative system that blends manual and automated chart specification to help analysts engage in both open-ended exploration and targeted question answering. We contribute two partial specification interfaces: wildcards let users specify multiple charts in parallel, while related views suggest visualizations relevant to the currently specified chart. We present our interface design and applications of the CompassQL visualization query language to enable these interfaces. In a controlled study we find that Voyager 2 leads to increased data field coverage compared to a traditional specification tool, while still allowing analysts to flexibly drill-down and answer specific questions.","tldr":"This work presents Voyager 2, a mixed-initiative system that blends manual and automated chart specification to help analysts engage in both open-ended exploration and targeted question answering and contributes two partial specification interfaces."}]}};
